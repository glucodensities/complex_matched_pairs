# Inference and cluster analysis for complex matched pairs by maximum mean discrepancy: An application to continuous glucose monitoring

A frequent problem in statistical data analysis is how to handle missing observations appropriately in
matched paired situations. Several strategies for the univariate case addressed this issue, but extensions
to more complex settings are rare. They contradict the urgent demand in modern medical research to
analyze more complex data, e.g., functional biomarkers such as continuous glucose monitoring or different
connectivity brain networks. We propose new estimators of the maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) to
handle complex matched paired missing data settings to fill this gap. The resulting novel procedure can
detect differences in distribution and mean of complex data sets and can be used to perform cluster
analysis for them. Its theoretical validity is proven and illustrated by an extensive simulation study, and
also theoretical consistency results are presented. Moreover, its applicability is exemplified by discussing
a recent population-based diabetes study, AEGIS, in which longitudinal information evolution of glucose
homeostasis with continuous glucose monitoring technology is avalaible, but there are significant losses
in the follow-ups. Ultimately, we obtain new pathophysiological criteria on how glucose changes vary at
the distributional level over five years that can inspire, for instance, new risk alert systems for patients with
impaired glucose conditions.
