# Inference and cluster analysis with missing data for complex matched pairs by maximum mean discrepancy: An application to continuous glucose monitoring.

A frequent problem in statistical science is how to handle missing observations in matched paired situations properly. Several strategies for the univariate case addressed this issue, but extensions to more complex settings are scarce. They contradict the urgent demand in modern medical research to analyze more complex data, e.g., functional digital biomarkers such as those provided by continuous glucose monitors or that arise different connectivity brain networks. In order to fill this gap, this paper proposes new estimators of the maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) to handle complex matched paired missing data. The novel approach can detect differences in the distribution or specific moments with complex statistical objects and can be used to perform cluster analysis.
